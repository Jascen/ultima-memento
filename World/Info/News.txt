NEW PLAYERS:
- Death is punishing at an early start. You must have gold to resurrect without penalty as early as 200 total (real) skill points. 
- You can, and will, lose items. Don't get attached.
- Start in Britain: minimap markers have been provided to give you better guidance. Add your own custom markers as you adventure!
- Seek multiple methods to generate gold: gather ingots, wood, or farm animals for their leather, meat, feathers, etc. and sell to vendors. Note that vendor gold purses are limited and restock over time - consider visiting other vendors or towns to continue selling your wares.
- Join a guild - this gives you a ring with +skills, and those specific skills gain at a quicker rate!
  - Be sure to speak to your Guild Masters and check their wares.
- Hiking boots can help you traverse the world swiftly.
- Make friends in game or via Discord, they can help!

Players familiar with Ruins & Riches and it's variants: 
- This server is a more challenging variant with Quality of Life updates.
- Do not rely solely on your recollection - while many aspects will be the same, we've made every effort to better streamline progression (e.g. item drops, crafting, etc.).
- All hail Djeryv, Mangar, and Xork! Credit where credit is due. This server exists because of them and their impressive groundwork. This is our little Memento.
